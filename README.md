btnx

btnx (Button Extension) is a daemon that enables rerouting of mouse button events through uinput as keyboard and other mouse button combinations. btnx requires btnx-config, a configuration tool for btnx. See https://github.com/btnx-config/ for more details.

History
----
btnx and btnx-config was originally written by [Olli Salonen](https://launchpad.net/~daou). However he has ceased development of the code and one of the repositories is lost. Afraid the code might be totally lost if it is not hosted somewhere, I acquired his blessing to move the project here and maintain it. (Meaning this isn't a fork.) It is now being maintained (albeit limitedly at the moment), particularly for major bugs.
